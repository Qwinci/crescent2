# Crescent2 (potentially to be renamed)
## A kernel and an OS distribution aiming for NT compatibility
Crescent2 is an os distribution and a kernel aiming both for
driver and userspace program compatibility with Windows NT.

Currently it is missing pretty much everything, first the focus is on getting basic drivers
working and then some basic syscalls.

### Features
- Uses [uACPI](https://github.com/uACPI/uACPI) aml interpreter that aims for NT compatibility
